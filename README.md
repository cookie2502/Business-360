## Introduction to AtliQ Hardware:
**Domain:** Consumer Goods | **Functions:** Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain and Executive

- AtliQ Hardwares is company that sells computer hardware and peripherals like PC, mouse, printer etc. to clients across the world.
- They have a major B2B business model wherein they sell to stores like Croma, Best Buy, Staples, Flipkart etc. who then sell it to the end users (consumers). These stores are their main customers.
- They sell through 3 channels: Retailer, Direct and Distributor.
- AtliQ Hardwares’s Customers are of two types. Both these Platforms are called Retailer channels.
  1. Brick & Mortar Customer: Actual physical stores e.g. Croma, Best Buy
  2. E-commerce Customer: Online websites E.g. Amazon, Flipkart
- AtliQ Hardwares also has a minor B2C business model wherein they own stores: AtliQ E-store and AtliQ Exclusive. These are called Direct channels.
- They also have Distributors in some countries with restricted trade. E.g. Neptune

## Project Objective:
AltiQ Hardware, a global leader in computers and accessories, faced unexpected losses after opening a store in America. These setbacks were identified to be caused due to reliance on outdated methods such as Excel for data analysis. To address this issue, the company's leadership recognized the need for a transformative approach to leveraging data for informed decision-making. With competitors boasting robust analytics teams, AltiQ Hardware recognizes the urgent need to develop its analytics capabilities using Power BI to thrive in the industry.

To outshine competitors, they've adopted Power BI for analytics with 1.8 million transaction records from Excel, CSV, and MySQL. The Power BI Dashboard includes:
- Home Page: Central navigation for Dashboard.
- Finance: Enhances financial planning.
- Sales: Boosts revenue and market share.
- Marketing: Elevates brand visibility.
- Supply Chain: Optimizes inventory management.
- Executive: Provides top management overview.

## Tools used:
1. Microsoft Power BI: for Data ETL, Data Modelling, Data Visualization & Dashboarding
2. GitHub - for Documentation

## Skills & Methodologies implemented:
1. Data Cleaning: **Power Query**
2. Data Manipulation: **DAX Measures & Columns, Numeric & Field Parameters**
3. Data Modelling
4. Data Visualization: **Conditional Formatting, Custom Tooltip**
5. Dashboarding: **Filters, Custom Icon Buttons, Slicers, Bookmarks, Page Navigation**
6. Report Publishing: **PBI Service and Report Optimization**
7. Documentation

  - ns_gm_target: 321 records | 5 columns

## Data Integrity:
ROCCC Evaluation:
- Reliability: MED - The raw dataset is created and updated by Codebasics. It has total 9 files. All of them were utilized in the analysis.
- Originality: HIGH - First party provider (Codebasics)
- Comprehensiveness: HIGH - Total 11 Files with a total of around 5.8 Million records were provided. Dataset contains multiple dimension parameters for Customers & Products as well as comprehensive sales transaction data.
- Current: MED - Dataset was updated upto FY 2022 i.e almost 2 years old. So its not very relevant. Any trends observed and insights gained need to be comprehended as a general (not FY-specific) trend.
- Citation: HIGH - Official citation/reference available.
